        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Forward Yesterday is an acoustic trio blending 90s alternative,
          grunge, and R&B with a fresh, stripped-down sound. Our setlist
          combines moody, introspective rock with groove-driven energy, offering
          a dynamic mix of familiar yet reimagined songs. With upright bass,
          acoustic guitar, and light percussion, we create an intimate
          atmosphere that brings nostalgia and new life to classic tracks.
