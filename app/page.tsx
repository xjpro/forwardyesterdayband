        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Forward Yesterday is an acoustic trio blending 90s alternative,
          grunge, and R&B with a fresh, stripped-down sound. Our setlist of moody rock and groove-driven R&B covers offers
          a mix of familiar yet reimagined songs. With upright bass,
          acoustic guitar, and light percussion, we bring new life to classic tracks.
